**Hi there! I'm Claudio Dekker, a full-stack web developer from Amsterdam (The Netherlands) with over ten years of professional experience.**

I've been writing software since I was eight, at which point I discovered that building software is awesome, and I pretty much haven't put the keyboard down since.

I'm currently working on a to-be announced project of my own, and occasionally also do consulting work through my own company, [Ubient](https://ubient.net).

In my spare time, I'm active within the open-source community, where I'm primarily known for my contributions as a core maintainer of [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com).

When I'm not working on code-stuff, you'll probably find me [playing a videogame](https://steamcommunity.com/id/arckedo), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/claudiodekker), or spending time offline with my family and friends.

If you need to message me securely, you can [encrypt your message](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html) using my PGP key: [`08FD B44B 6D63 2021 5D1E E8C1 3025 FFE2 33CC C24B`](https://keybase.io/claudiodekker/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=08fdb44b6d6320215d1ee8c13025ffe233ccc24b)
