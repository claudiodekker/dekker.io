**Hi there! I'm Claudio Dekker, a full-stack web developer and consultant from Amsterdam (The Netherlands) with over ten years of professional experience.**

I'm part of the amazing team over at [Laravel](https://laravel.com) where I primarily work on [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com),
and occasionally also do consultancy work through my own company [Ubient](https://ubient.net).

In my spare time, I'm active within the open-source community, where I'm primarily known for my contributions as a core maintainer of [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com).

I've been writing software since I was eight, at which point I discovered that building software is awesome, and I pretty much haven't put the keyboard down since.

When I'm not working on code-stuff, you'll probably find me [playing a videogame](https://steamcommunity.com/id/arckedo), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/claudiodekker), or spending time offline with my family and friends.
